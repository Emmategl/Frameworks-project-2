Project 2: Development of Webshop RESTful API
The developed RESTful API should enable clients to get information about the webshop offer and support operations on the userâ€™s shopping basket.

- Create a shopping basket for a specific user.
- Put a product in the basket for a specific user.
- Remove a product from the basket for a specific user.
- Get the shopping basket content for a specific user.

Non-Functional requirements:
- API should be developed in JavaScript using Node.js and Express framework.
- API should use JSON as data format in HTTP messages.
- Data about products, categories and the shopping basket content should be stored on the webserver in a single file in JSON format.

Project activities
The project consists of two main activities: RESTful API specification and realization.

1. API Specification
In this activity you should analyze, design and specify your web shop API. The main steps are the following:
(a) Identify resources and their URIs
(b) Define operations in terms of HTTP methods
(c) Define details of each operation

2. API Realization
In this activity you should implement the specified API in Node.js/Express environment.
